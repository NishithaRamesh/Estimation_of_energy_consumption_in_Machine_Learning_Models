# Estimation_of_energy_consumption_in_Machine_Learning_Models

Both Pre-trained and untrained MobileNet Machine Learning model is trained on randomly choosen 10 classes from CIFAR100 dataset. Energy Consumption for this process is estimated using different methods. 


List of Tasks: (Step by Step)

1. Finding different methods of calculating/estimating energy consumption in ML
2. Select 3 different methods and implement them.
3. Apply the methods to different models (machine vision models)
4. Searching about “How to reduce the energy consumption of the machine learning models”
5. Implementing 2 techniques for reducing energy consumption in ML
6. Compare the results
